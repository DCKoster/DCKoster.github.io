        <p> One solution to the problem of having infinite worlds is given by \citeauthor{vanditmarschWhoHasSum2015a} \citeyearpar{vanditmarschWhoHasSum2015a} and is described in this section. 
            We will copy their strategy, but while \citeauthor{vanditmarschWhoHasSum2015a} do not mention Kripke models, 
            we will explain the strategy more formally as a Kripke model, including and public announcement logic.</p>

        <p> Even though \citeauthor{vanditmarschWhoHasSum2015a} do not mention Kripke models, they do create one, 
            instead calling it a binary tree of uncertainty. This model is constructed by starting with world \( (2, 1, 1) \), 
            then adding all worlds that have a relation with this world, then adding all worlds that have a relation with those worlds, 
            and so on. Every such recursive step is done in the following, systematic way.</p>

        <p> Each world has 3 relations \( \sim_a \), \( \sim_b \), and \( \sim_c \) with other worlds, 1 for each agent, 
            because as explained before, the agents know they have either the sum or the difference of the other two numbers.
            To construct the model recursively, for every world \( w = (n_a, n_b, n_c) \), the worlds \( u \) and \( v \) 
            are added to the Kripke model, where </p>

        <div>
            <img src="/assets/threesum_world_progression.png" alt="A formula to explain how the progession of worlds goes">
        </div>

        <p> where \( max = max(n_a,n_b,n_c) \). </p>

        <p> We claimed that each world has 3 relations to other worlds, but there is an exception: the world \( (2, 1, 1) \). 
            We call this a "root world", because this is starting point from where all worlds are added to the model with equation \ref{eq:branch}. 
            We define a root world as follows:</p>

        <p class="root-world">A root world is a world that has a smaller number of relations with other worlds than the number of agents, before any public announcements are made.<span class="equation-number">(2)</span></p>
        <p class="specifically">Specifically,</p>
        <p class="indent">For the riddle “Who has the Sum” with 3 agents, a world is a root world iff the difference between the two smallest numbers is smaller than or equal to 0.<span class="equation-number">(3)</span></p>
        <p class="indent">In a root world, at least one of the agents knows what their own number is before any announcements are made. 
            For example, the root world \( (2, 1, 1) \) has only two relations because Achmed sees two 1’s, and therefore knows he himself
            has the sum 2, since the difference \( 1 − 1 \) is 0, and only positive integers are allowed according to the riddle.</p>

        <p> As mentioned, public announcement act as model transformers. When an announcement \( \varphi \) is made, all worlds where \( \varphi \) does not hold, are removed from
            the model to form the reduced model. Now consider the case where there are no root worlds. All worlds have three relations with other worlds, and therefore
            in every world, every agent is not sure what their own number is. In this case, when any of the first three announcements are made, the reduced model is the
            exact same as the initial model, because in every world it holds that none of the agents know their number. Additionally, Achmeds announcement \( K_a 50_a \) would
            create an empty reduced model.</p>

        <p> This makes it clear that the riddle can not be solved when there are no root worlds. When there are root worlds however, these may not be included
            in the reduced model after an announcement is made. This makes it so that the worlds which had relation \( \sim_i \) with the root world, agent <i>i</i> now knows what
            their number is. The riddle can therefore be solved by reducing the model four times, once for every public announcement, if it eventually leads to a reduced
            model where Achmed knows that his number is 50. The answer to the riddle would be the numbers of Bert and Carl in that world.</p>

        <p> This also solves the problem of having infinite worlds. For the same reason that a model without any root world <i>r</i> would not lead to a solution, the worlds
            <i>w</i> where <i>k</i> &gt; 4 in <i>r</i> &rarr;<sup><i>k</i></sup> <i>w</i>, are irrelevant. This is because it is impossible for any
            agent to know their number in any of these worlds even after all announcements are made. Additionally, none of the worlds where <i>k</i> = 4 can be worlds where
            Achmed knows his number is 50. These worlds are only necessary to model because they can have relations with worlds where <i>k</i> = 3, which <i>can</i> be worlds
            where Achmed knows his number is 50.</p>
