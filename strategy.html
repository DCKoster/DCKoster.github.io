        <p> One solution to the problem of having infinite worlds is given by \citeauthor{vanditmarschWhoHasSum2015a} \citeyearpar{vanditmarschWhoHasSum2015a} and is described in this section. 
            We will copy their strategy, but while \citeauthor{vanditmarschWhoHasSum2015a} do not mention Kripke models, 
            we will explain the strategy more formally as a Kripke model, including and public announcement logic.</p>

        <p> Even though \citeauthor{vanditmarschWhoHasSum2015a} do not mention Kripke models, they do create one, 
            instead calling it a binary tree of uncertainty. This model is constructed by starting with world \( (2, 1, 1) \), 
            then adding all worlds that have a relation with this world, then adding all worlds that have a relation with those worlds, 
            and so on. Every such recursive step is done in the following, systematic way.</p>

        <p> Each world has 3 relations \( \sim_a \), \( \sim_b \), and \( \sim_c \) with other worlds, 1 for each agent, 
            because as explained before, the agents know they have either the sum or the difference of the other two numbers.
            To construct the model recursively, for every world \( w = (n_a, n_b, n_c) \), the worlds \( u \) and \( v \) 
            are added to the Kripke model, where </p>

        <div>
            <img src="/assets/threesum_world_progression.png" alt="A formula to explain how the progession of worlds goes">
        </div>

        <p> where \( max = max(n_a,n_b,n_c) \). </p>

        <p> We claimed that each world has 3 relations to other worlds, but there is an exception: the world \( (2, 1, 1) \). 
            We call this a "root world", because this is starting point from where all worlds are added to the model with equation \ref{eq:branch}. 
            We define a root world as follows:</p>

        <p class="indented-big"> A root world is a world that has a smaller number of relations with other worlds than the number of agents, before any public announcements are made.<span class="equation-number">(2)</span></p>
        <p class="indented"> Specifically, </p>
        <p class="indented-big">For the riddle “Who has the Sum” with 3 agents, a world is a root world <i>iff</i> the difference between the two smallest numbers is smaller than or equal to 0.<span class="equation-number">(3)</span></p>
        
        
        <p> In a root world, at least one of the agents knows what their own number is before any announcements are made. 
            For example, the root world \( (2, 1, 1) \) has only two relations because Achmed sees two 1’s, and therefore knows he himself
            has the sum 2, since the difference \( 1 − 1 \) is 0, and only positive integers are allowed according to the riddle.</p>

        <p> As mentioned, public announcement act as model transformers. When an announcement \( \varphi \) is made, all worlds where \( \varphi \) does not hold, are removed from
            the model to form the reduced model. Now consider the case where there are no root worlds. All worlds have three relations with other worlds, and therefore
            in every world, every agent is not sure what their own number is. In this case, when any of the first three announcements are made, the reduced model is the
            exact same as the initial model, because in every world it holds that none of the agents know their number. Additionally, Achmeds announcement \( K_a 50_a \) would
            create an empty reduced model.</p>

        <p> This makes it clear that the riddle can not be solved when there are no root worlds. When there are root worlds however, these may not be included
            in the reduced model after an announcement is made. This makes it so that the worlds which had relation \( \sim_i \) with the root world, agent <i>i</i> now knows what
            their number is. The riddle can therefore be solved by reducing the model four times, once for every public announcement, if it eventually leads to a reduced
            model where Achmed knows that his number is 50. The answer to the riddle would be the numbers of Bert and Carl in that world.</p>

        <p> This also solves the problem of having infinite worlds. For the same reason that a model without any root world <i>r</i> would not lead to a solution, the worlds
            <i>w</i> where <i>k</i> &gt; 4 in <i>r</i> &rarr;<sup><i>k</i></sup> <i>w</i>, are irrelevant. This is because it is impossible for any
            agent to know their number in any of these worlds even after all announcements are made. Additionally, none of the worlds where <i>k</i> = 4 can be worlds where
            Achmed knows his number is 50. These worlds are only necessary to model because they can have relations with worlds where <i>k</i> = 3, which <i>can</i> be worlds
            where Achmed knows his number is 50.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="/assets/threesum_three_worlds.png" alt="A root world with two nodes">
            <figcaption>Figure 1: Three worlds in the model with root node \( (2, 1, 1) \), where relations
                        with other worlds are not drawn.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>We have now explained how and <i>why</i> the initial model is constructed by recursively adding worlds starting at the root world \( (2, 1, 1) \), but there are more
            root worlds, namely \( (1, 2, 1) \) and \( (1, 1, 2) \). In world \( (2, 1, 1) \) Achmed knows his number, in world \( (1, 2, 1) \) Bert knows his number, and in world \( (1, 1, 2) \) Carl
            knows his number. For each of these root worlds a model can be recursively created with equation 1. However, due to equation 1, none of these models have
            any world in common. Therefore the three models can simply be combined into one model, which has three separated clusters of worlds. The public announcement can be used to reduce this model in its entirety.</p>

        <p>An apparent problem is that these three are not the only root worlds—so is
            for example the world \( (4, 2, 2) \). Yet this world will not be included in the model.
            But:</p>

        <p class="indented-big"> All models with a root world where the numbers follow the pattern \( (2x, x, x) \), are <i>bisimilulations</i> of all other models
            with a root world where the numbers follow the pattern \( (2x, x, x) \). <span class="equation-number">(4)</span></p>

        <p>Bisimulations are models where corresponding states represent the same atomic information, and where all relations are identical (Blackburn et al., 2001,
            p. 64). In this case, all models with the root world \( (2x, x, x) \) are bisimilar since all worlds become identical after dividing all numbers in one of the models by
            <i>x</i>. For example, the worlds \( (2, 1, 1) \), \( (2, 3, 1) \), and \( (2, 1, 3) \) in figure 1 could be replaced with the worlds \( (10, 5, 5) \), \( (10, 15, 5) \), and \( (10, 5, 15) \) by multiplying all
            numbers by 5. In the same way, all models with a root world \( (x, 2x, x) \) are bisimilar, as are those with a root world \( (x, x, 2x) \) because the relations are
            identical. Of course all these models are rather parts/cluster of the complete Kripke model, but that does not matter since there are no relations between
            the clusters.</p>

        <p class="indented"> To conclude: </p>
        <ol class="indented">
            <li>  The bisimilar models of the model with root nodes \( (2, 1, 1) \), \( (1, 2, 1) \), and \( (1, 1, 2) \) include all possible root worlds. </li>
            <li> Achmed can only know his number in the worlds <i>w</i> where <i>k</i> &lt; 4 in <i>r</i> &rarr;<sup>k</sup> <i>w</i>.</li>
        </ol>

        <p> So to complete this strategy, the task is to create the model with root nodes \( (2, 1, 1) \), \( (1, 2, 1) \), and \( (1, 1, 2) \) 
        with only the worlds <i>w</i> where <i>k</i> &lt; 4 in <i>r</i> &rarr;<sup>k</sup> <i>w</i>, to reduce the model with the public announcements, to find in the final reduced
model the world where Achmed knows his number is a multiple of 50 ( \( K_a x_a \) for any <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> where \( x * y = 50 \)), and to finally note the numbers of the others in
that world (\(n_b)\ and \(n_c\)) </p>
