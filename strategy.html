        <p> One solution to the problem of having infinite worlds is given by \citeauthor{vanditmarschWhoHasSum2015a} \citeyearpar{vanditmarschWhoHasSum2015a} and is described in this section. 
            We will copy their strategy, but while \citeauthor{vanditmarschWhoHasSum2015a} do not mention Kripke models, 
            we will explain the strategy more formally as a Kripke model, including and public announcement logic.</p>

        <p> Even though \citeauthor{vanditmarschWhoHasSum2015a} do not mention Kripke models, they do create one, 
            instead calling it a binary tree of uncertainty. This model is constructed by starting with world \( (2, 1, 1) \), 
            then adding all worlds that have a relation with this world, then adding all worlds that have a relation with those worlds, 
            and so on. Every such recursive step is done in the following, systematic way.</p>

        <p> Each world has 3 relations \( \sim_a \), \( \sim_b \), and \( \sim_c \) with other worlds, 1 for each agent, 
            because as explained before, the agents know they have either the sum or the difference of the other two numbers.
            To construct the model recursively, for every world \( w = (n_a, n_b, n_c) \), the worlds \( u \) and \( v \) 
            are added to the Kripke model, where </p>

        <p> where (\ max = max(n_a,n_b,n_c) \). </p>

        <p> We claimed that each world has 3 relations to other worlds, but there is an exception: the world (\ (2, 1, 1) \). 
            We call this a <code>&ldquo;root world&rdquo;</code>, 
            because this is starting point from where all worlds are added to the model with equation \ref{eq:branch}. 
            We define a root world as follows:</p>
