        <h2>4 Person Variation</h2>

        <p>Our 4 person variation of the ”Who has the sum?” goes as follows (the differences are in <b>bold</b>):</p>
        <p>Achmed, Bert, Carl, <b>and Dana</b> all have a positive integer on their forehead. 
            They can only see the foreheads of others. One of the numbers is the sum of the other <b>three. 
                None of the numbers are larger than 40.</b> 
            All the previous is common knowledge, all agents are perfect logicians, and they always speak the truth, 
            which is also common knowledge. They now successively make the truthful announcements:</p>
        <ol class="indented">
            <li>Achmed: “I don’t know my number.”</li>
            <li>Bert: “I don’t know my number.”</li>
            <li>Carl: “I don’t know my number.”</li>
            <li><b>Dana: “I don’t know my number.”</b></li>
            <li>Achmed: “I know my number. It is N4.”</li>
        </ol>
        <p>What are the other numbers?</p>

        <p class="indented"> The public announcements are now formally as follows:  </p>
    
        <ol class="indented">
            <li>\( \neg K_a 1_a \land \neg K_a 2_a \land \ldots \land \neg K_a x_a \) (for all \( x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \))</li>
            <li>\( \neg K_b 1_b \land \neg K_b 2_b \land \ldots \land \neg K_b x_b \) (for all \( x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \))</li>
            <li>\( \neg K_c 1_c \land \neg K_c 2_c \land \ldots \land \neg K_c x_c \) (for all \( x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \))</li>
            <li>\( \neg K_d 1_d \land \neg K_d 2_d \land \ldots \land \neg K_d x_d \) (for all \( x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \))</li>
            <li>\( K_a N4_a \)</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="indented"> The differences with the 3 person riddle are, summarised: </p>

        <ol class="indented">
            <li> There are 4 agents rather than 3. </li>
            <li> There are 5 public announcements rather than 4. </li>
            <li>  Achmed’s number is not 50, but N4. This is a variable which can be modified to give different answers for the riddle. </li>
            <li> None of the numbers are larger than 40. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            For the model itself, each world <i>w</i> now represents 4 numbers \( n_a, n_b, n_c,\) and \( n_d \) and is referenced as \( (n_a, n_b, n_c, n_d) \). 
            Each world has 4 relations \( \sim_a, \sim_b, \sim_c \), and \( \sim_d \) with other worlds, because the agents know they have either the
            sum or the difference of the other three numbers (the largest number they see
            minus the sum of the two smallest numbers they see). To construct the model
            recursively, for every world \( w = (n_a, n_b, n_c, n_d) \), the worlds <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, and <i>v</i> are added
            to the Kripke model, where </p>
        <div>
            <img src="/assets/foursum_world_progression.png" alt="A formula to explain how the progession of worlds goes">
        </div>

        <p> where \( max = max(n_a,n_b,n_c,n_d) \). </p>

        <p> In contrast to the 3 person riddle, and in contrast to <a href="strategy.html">definition 3</a>, a root
        world for the 4 person variation is defined as such: </p>

        <p class="indented-big"> For the riddle “Who has the Sum” with 4 agents, a world is a root world <i>iff</i> the difference between the second largest
            number and the sum of the two smallest numbers is smaller than or equal to 0. <span class="equation-number">(6)</span></p>

        <p>
            Somewhat similar to the 3 person riddle, four of the root worlds are \( (3, 1, 1, 1) \), \( (1, 3, 1, 1) \), \( (1, 1, 3, 1) \), and \( (1, 1, 1, 3) \), 
            where the world \( w = (n_a, n_b, n_c, n_d) \) follows the pattern \( (3x, x, x, x) \) for any order of \( n_a, n_b, n_c, \) and \( n_d \). 
            However, there are more than these. In fact, there is an infinite number of root worlds. For
            example, all worlds that follow the pattern \( (2x, x, y, z) \), such as \( (4, 2, 1, 1) \), are
            root worlds. And there are many root worlds that do not follow such a specific
            pattern, which makes it so that there is an unlimited number of models that
            are <i>not</i> bisimilar. This is why we added to the riddle that none of the numbers are larger than 40.
        </p>

        <p>
            In regards to our research question of whether a Kripke Model will still be efficient when implemented on variants of “Who has the Sum?” if fundamental
            changes are made to the riddle, the fundamental change we make here is that instead of 3 root worlds, there is much larger number of them.
        </p>

        <p>
            While for the 3 person variation the worlds <i>w</i> where <i>k</i> &gt; 4 in <i>r</i> &rarr;<sup><i>k</i></sup> <i>w</i> are irrelevant, for the 4 person variation 
            the worlds <i>w</i> where <i>k</i> &gt; 5 in <i>r</i> &rarr;<sup><i>k</i></sup> <i>w</i> are irrelevant. This is because there is one more announcement.
        </p>

        <p>
            To complete the strategy for this variation, the task is to create the model that contains <b>all</b> root worlds, but with only the worlds 
            <i>w</i> where <i>k</i> &le; <b>5</b> in <i>r</i> &rarr;<sup><i>k</i></sup> <i>w</i>, to reduce the model with the public announcements, 
            to find in the final reduced model the world where Achmed knows his number is a multiple of <b>N4</b>
            ( \( K_a x_a \) for any <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> where \( x * y = N4 \) ), and to finally note the numbers of the others in that world \( (n_b, n_c, \) <b>and</b> \( n_d) \).
        </p>

    <!-- Product variation -->
    <div class="content">
        <h2> Product Variation</h2>

        <p>Our product variation of the ”Who has the sum?” (”Who has the product?”) goes as follows (the differences are in <b>bold</b>):</p>
        <p>Achmed, Bert, and Carl all have a positive integer on their forehead. 
            They can only see the foreheads of others. One of the numbers is the <b>product</b> of the other two. 
            <b>None of the numbers are larger than 50.</b>
            All the previous is common knowledge, all agents are perfect logicians, and they always speak the truth, 
            which is also common knowledge. They now successively make the truthful announcements:</p>
        <ol class="indented">
            <li>Achmed: “I don’t know my number.”</li>
            <li>Bert: “I don’t know my number.”</li>
            <li>Carl: “I don’t know my number.”</li>
            <li>Achmed: “I know my number. It is <b>NP</b>.”</li>
        </ol>
        <p>What are the other numbers?</p>
        
        <p class="indented"> The public announcements are now formally as follows:  </p>
    
        <ol class="indented">
            <li>\( \neg K_a 1_a \land \neg K_a 2_a \land \ldots \land \neg K_a x_a \) (for all \( x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \))</li>
            <li>\( \neg K_b 1_b \land \neg K_b 2_b \land \ldots \land \neg K_b x_b \) (for all \( x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \))</li>
            <li>\( \neg K_c 1_c \land \neg K_c 2_c \land \ldots \land \neg K_c x_c \) (for all \( x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \))</li>
            <li>\( K_a NP_a \)</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="indented"> The differences with the 3 person riddle are, summarised: </p>

        <ol class="indented">
            <li> One of the numbers is the product of the other two instead of the sum. </li>
            <li>  None of the numbers are larger than 50. </li>
            <li>  Achmed’s number is not 50, but NP. Again, this is a variable which can be modified to give different answers for the riddle. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            To construct the model recursively for this variation, for every world \( w =
            (n_a, n_b, n_c) \), one of, or both worlds <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> are added to the Kripke model, where
        </p>

        <div>
            <img src="/assets/product_world_progression.png" alt="A formula to explain how the progession of worlds goes">
        </div>

        <p> where \( max = max(n_a,n_b,n_c) \). </p>

        <p> In contrast to the 3 person riddle, and in contrast to <a href="strategy.html">definition 3</a>, a root
        world for the product variation is defined as such: </p>

        <p class="indented-big"> For the riddle “Who has the Product” with 3 agents, a
            world is a root world <i>iff</i> the two largest numbers are
            identical, or if the division of the second largest number by
            the smallest number is not an integer. <span class="equation-number">(8)</span></p>

        <p>
            When the two largest numbers are identical, a root world \( w = (n_a, n_b, n_c) \)
            follows the pattern \( (1, x, x) \) for any order of \( n_a, n_b, \) and \( n_c \). Root worlds where
            the division of the second largest number by the smallest number is not an
            integer, do not follow a specific pattern. This is just a matter of rounding.
            Again, there is an infinite number of root worlds, when the limit of 50 is not taken into account. And again, there is an unlimited number
            of models that are <i>not</i> bisimilar. In fact, we can not make use of bisimilarity at
            all, because for example if we multiple the numbers in the world \( (2, 2, 1) \) by 2,
            we get \( (4, 4, 2) \), in which 4 is not the product of 4 and 2. For this variation we
            added to the riddle that none of the numbers are larger than 50.
        </p>

        <p>
            In regards to our research question of whether a Kripke Model will still be
            efficient when implemented on variants of “Who has the Sum?” if fundamental
            changes are made to the riddle, the fundamental change we make here is that
            we remove the option to consider bisimilar models. And like the 4 person sum
            variation, there are more root worlds.
        </p>

        <p>
            To complete the strategy for this variation, the task is to create the model
            that contains all root worlds, with only the worlds <i>w</i> where <i>k</i> &le; 4 in <i>r</i> &rarr;<sup><i>k</i></sup> <i>w</i>, to
            reduce the model with the public announcements, to find in the final reduced
            model the world where Achmed knows his number is <b>exactly NP</b> \( (K_a x_NP) \), and to finally note the numbers of the others in
            that world (\(n_b\) and \(n_c\)).
