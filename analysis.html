        <!-- Root world 1 -->
        <h4>Root world (2, 1, 1)</h4>
        <p>
            For the Analysis, the three different root worlds \( (2, 1, 1) \), \( (1, 2, 1) \) and \( (1, 1, 2) \) are incorporated into a Kripke Model. 
            As it is not possible for these worlds to reach each other, they will be shown in separate figures to provide a better understanding of what is happening at each step.</p> 

        <p>
            The first root world will be \( (2, 1, 1) \). This root world is in the form \( (n_a, n_b, n_c) \) with \( max = n_a \). As explained in <a href="formalModel.html">the formal model</a>, it is connected to \( u = (n_a, [n_a + n_c], n_c) \) through \(w \sim_b u\) 
            and \( v = (n_a, n_b, [n_a + n_b]) \) through \(w \sim_c v\).  
            The worlds will continue to branch out, with each world having one relation for agent <i>a</i> (Achmed), one for agent <i>b</i> (Bert) and one for agent <i>c</i> (Carl). 
            The root world of this part of the Kripke Model can be seen in figure 1

        </p>

        <p>
            After the first public announcement, in which Achmed announces that he does not know his number, 
            the world \( (2, 1, 1) \) is removed from the model. The announcement does not hold here because Achmed would know his number, as was explained in <a href="strategy.html">the strategy</a>. 
            The second state can be seen in figure 2. 
        </p>

        <figure class="image-container" style="max-width: 100%;">

                    all worlds where this announcement does not hold are removed.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Bert is second to announce that he does not know his number. 
            He logically reasoned that the numbers he is seeing, are not a multiple of the worlds in which he is sure what the numbers would be, which for Bert is the world \( (2, 3, 1) \). 
            Thus the public announcement does not hold here and this world is removed. 
            Figure 3 shows the third state, which occurs after Bert his announcement.

        </div>

        <p>
            Carl is the third one to announce he does not know his number. 
            Again, he logically reasoned that the numbers on the heads of the other two are not multiples of the worlds he is sure he knows the number. 
            The worlds which are removed because the public announcement does not hold, are \( (2, 3, 5) \) and \( (2, 1, 3) \). 
            The result of his announcement is in figure 4
        </p>

        <p>
            After the three public announcements that Achmed, Bert and Carl do not know their number, 
            Achmed announces that he now knows his number and that it is 50. 
            All worlds in which Achmed can be sure to know his number are highlighted in figure 5, 
            which are \( (4, 3, 1) \), \( (8, 3, 5) \) and \( (4, 1, 3) \)

    <!-- Root world 2 -->
    <h4>Root world (1, 2, 1)</h4>

        <p>
            The second root world is \( (1, 2, 1) \). 
            This root world is in the form \( (n_a, n_b, n_c) \) with \( max = n_b \). 
            As explained in <a href="formalModel.html">the formal model</a> it is connected to \( u = ([n_b + n_c], n_b, n_c) \) through \(w \sim_a u\) and \( v = (n_a, n_b, [n_a + n_b]) \) through \(w \sim_c v\).
            The root world has the same branching structure as the previous one, which can be seen in figure 6 
        </p>
        
        
        <figure class="image-container" style="max-width: 100%;">

                    All edges are colour coded. </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            The first public announcement of Achmed does not influence the model as there is no world where it does not hold. 
            The second public announcement by Bert does, as the announcement does not hold in the root world \( (1, 2, 1) \). 
            The resulting model is shown in figure 7 
        </p>

                    all worlds where this announcement does not hold are removed.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            The third public announcement by Carl influences the model by removing the world where the announcement does not hold, \( (1 ,2, 3) \). 
            The model after the third announcement is shown in figure 8. 
        </p>
        
        <figure class="image-container" style="max-width: 100%;">

        </figure>
        <p>
            Lastly, Achmed now announces he knows his number again, which leaves the worlds where the announcement, \( (3, 2, 1) \) and \( (5, 2, 3) \), to be highlighted in red in figure 9. 
        </p>

    <!-- Root world 3 -->
    <h4>Root world (1, 1, 2)</h4>
        <p>
            The third root world is \( (1, 1, 2) \). 
            This root world is in the form \( (n_a, n_b, n_c) \) with \( max = n_c \). 
            As explained in <a href="formalModel.html">the formal model</a> it is connected to \( u = ([n_b + n_c], n_b, n_c) \) through \(w \sim_a u\) and \( v = (n_a, [n_a + n_c], n_c) \) through \(w \sim_b v\).
            The root world can be seen in figure 10.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container" style="max-width: 100%;">
            <img src="/assets/3_1.png" alt="The first step of the analysis">
            <p>Figure 10: The graph which results from the root world (1, 1, 2). 
                    All edges are colour coded.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            This time, the first and second public announcements, from Achmed and Bert respectively, do not influence the model as there are no worlds where they do not hold. 
            The third one by Carl does influence it and removes the root worlds, \( (1, 1, 2) \), where the announcement does not hold. This first step is depicted in figure 11.
        </p>
        <figure class="image-container" style="max-width: 100%;">
                <img src="/assets/3_2.png" alt="The first step of the analysis ">
                <figcaption>Figure 11: When the third public announcement is made, 
                    all worlds where this announcement does not hold are removed. </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>   The last announcement by Achmed provides one world where it holds, \( (3, 1, 2) \), which is highlighted in figure 12. 
        </p>
        
        <figure class="image-container" style="max-width: 100%;">
                <img src="/assets/3_3.png" alt="Another step of the analysis ">
                <figcaption>Figure 12: The graph after the last public announcement. All worlds where it holds are highlighted in red.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            After going through all public announcement through every root world, the worlds \( (4, 3, 1), (8, 3, 5), (4, 1, 3), (3, 2, 1), (5, 2, 3)\ and \(3, 1, 2) \) are highlighted as worlds where the announcement \(K_a 50_a\) holds. 
            In the true world his number is 50, so \( 50_a \). In the bisimilar world, his number \( n_a \) should be a divisor of 50.
            Thus \(n_a\) can be either 1, 2, 5, 10, 25 or 50. Only for the world \( (5, 2, 3) \) is \(n_a\) a divisor of 50.
            This leaves the conclusion that the actual world is \( (50, 20, 30) \), where Achmed has 50 on his head, Bert 20 and Carl 30: \((n_a, n_b, n_c) = (50, 20, 30) \)
