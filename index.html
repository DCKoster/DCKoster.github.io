        <h2>An Introduction to the Who has the Sum Riddle</h2>
        <p>In this project we analyze the riddle “Who has the Sum?” which was invented by Jonathan Welton. 
            The riddle goes as follows <a href="#references">(van Ditmarsch & Kooi, 2015)</a>:</p>
        <p>Achmed, Bert, and Carl all have a positive integer on their forehead. 
            They can only see the foreheads of others. One of the numbers is the sum of the other two. 
            All the previous is common knowledge, all agents are perfect logicians, they always speak the truth, 
            which is also common knowledge. They now successively make the truthful announcements:</p>
        <ol class="indented">
            <li>Achmed: “I don’t know my number.”</li>
            <li>Bert: “I don’t know my number.”</li>
            <li>Carl: “I don’t know my number.”</li>
            <li>Achmed: “I know my number. It is 50.”</li>
        </ol>
        <p>What are the other numbers?</p>
        
        <p>To answer the riddle, we use Kripke possible worlds semantics. 
            We first create a Kripke model that represents the initial state of information before any announcements are made. 
            Then, as announcements are made, the number of possible worlds in the model decreases according to 
            public announcement logic (the model is reduced), until there is only one world where Achmed knows that his number is 50.
            The numbers of Bert and Carl in that world will be the answer to the riddle.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, two variants to the riddle will be introduced which will alter some fundamental aspects of the riddle. 
            Kripke Models will be used to answer these variants. Our research question is: 
            How efficient are Kripke Models when implemented on variants of “Who has the Sum?” 
            if fundamental changes are made to the riddle?</p>
