        <h2>An Introduction to the Who has the Sum Riddle</h2>
        <p>
            In this project we analyze the riddle “Who has the Sum?” which was invented
            by Jonathan Welton. The riddle goes as follows (van Ditmarsch & Kooi, 2015):
            Achmed, Bert, and Carl all have a positive integer on their forehead. They
            can only see the foreheads of others. One of the numbers is the sum of the other
            two. All the previous is common knowledge, all agents are perfect logicians, they
            always speak the truth, which is also common knowledge. They now successively
            make the truthful announcements:
            1. Achmed: “I don’t know my number.”
            2. Bert: “I don’t know my number.”
            3. Carl: “I don’t know my number.”
            4. Achmed: “I know my number. It is 50.”
            What are the other numbers?
        </p>
