# Strategy
The key to getting to the solution for this riddle, is breaking down how knowledge progresses when the public announcements are made. In the analysis, which will be shown in the next paragraph, the step-by-step influence of these public announcements are shown. In this strategies section, the way to solve the riddle is discussed. 

The model starts with the smallest possible values they can take. Notice that the riddle specifies “positive integers”, ruling the number 0 out and making the smallest possible values 1, 1 and 2. These numbers can be put in three different orders: (2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1) and (1, 1, 2). For the first one, Achmed would have the 2 on his head and he would know this, because if seeing two ones he must have the sum, as 0 is ruled out. The same logic applies to the other combinations. 
From this point on, the public announcements will affect the Kripke Model. As mentioned in the formal model, worlds are connected to each other by a relation of one of the three participants. Because in (2, 1, 1) Achmed would know he has the sum, but he first says he does not know what he has, it means he does not see two ones. When his announcement is given, the other two also realise this and the world (2, 1, 1) would not be considered a possible world any more. This way of thinking will continue for the other public announcement, until Achmed announces that he knows his number is 50.
