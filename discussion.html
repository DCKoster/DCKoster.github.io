            In this project, it has been shown that the "Who has the Sum" riddle can be solved by Kripke Models. 
            It was already solved in a very similar way <a href="index.html#references"  class="reference-link">(van Ditmarsch and Kooi, 2015)</a>, 
            but this project has formalized the model using the language of announcement logic and 
            shown within the implementation that the answer of \( (50, 20, 30) \) is indeed the only answer possible. 
            The variants implemented in this report, show interesting but similar results.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first, adding an agent to the riddle looked like a relatively small change. 
            However, when looking at the effect it has, it was enough to completely renew the riddle. 
            The extra branches that arise from the extra agent was not the only change resulting from this. 
            The extra agent caused the formula defining the root worlds in the original riddle to be insufficient, 
            as those root worlds and their bisimilar worlds were not enough anymore to reach all possible worlds. 
            This resulted in the amount of root worlds exploding towards infinity, making the Kripke Model approach not efficient anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the "Who has the Product" riddle, the same can be seen. By removing the bisimilarity of the disconnected trees, 
            the amount of root worlds also exploded. Because of this, the same conclusion can be made as in the other variation: 
            the Kripke Model approach is not efficient when solving this riddle. 
        </p>

        <p>
            
        </p>

        <h3>Future Work</h3>
        <p>
            The variations of the "Who has the Sum" riddle both have an infinite number of root worlds, 
            which is problematic for the Kripke Model. Example formulas for root worlds are given 
            ( \( (3x, x, x, x) \) and \( (2x, x, y, z) \) for the four persons, and \( (1, x, x) \) for the product riddle), 
            however no complete definitions of the root worlds have been given in this project. 
            As this was not within the scope of the project, no further effort to define them other than the example formulas
            (and some others which were left out) has been spent on this problem. 
            It would be interesting to see if a definition for all root worlds, for both or either of the variations, 
            exists and if so, what it would be.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, the project has shown that the variations are not efficiently solvable by a Kripke Model approach. 
            Another approach which would not feature Kripke Model, but perhaps some other mathematical concept, 
            could be found to do find an efficient way to solve the riddle. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The last suggestion is a minor one. As the project focused on testing the efficiency of the strategy on 
            the variations, no further effort was put into actually formulating a solution to the riddle. 
            The authors would be interested to know whether it there is a possible solution when Achmed announces his number, 
            and what that number would be.
