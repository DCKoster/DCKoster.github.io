        <h3>Future Work</h3>
        <p>
            The variations of the "Who has the Sum" riddle both have an infinite number of root worlds, 
            which is problematic for the Kripke Model. Example formulas for root worlds are given 
            ( \( (3x, x, x, x) \) and \( (2x, x, y, z) \) for the four persons, and \( (1, x, x) \) for the product riddle), 
            however no complete definitions of the root worlds have been given in this project. 
            As this was not within the scope of the project, no further effort to define them other than the example formulas
            (and some others which were left out) has been spent on this problem. 
            It would be interesting to see if a definition for all root worlds, for both or either of the variations, 
            exists and if so, what it would be.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, the project has shown that the variations are not efficiently solvable by a Kripke Model approach. 
            Another approach which would not feature Kripke Model, but perhaps some other mathematical concept, 
            could be found to do find an efficient way to solve the riddle. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The last suggestion is a minor one. As the project focused on testing the efficiency of the strategy on 
            the variations, no further effort was put into actually formulating a solution to the riddle. 
            The authors would be interested to know whether it there is a possible solution when Achmed announces his number, 
            and what that number would be.
