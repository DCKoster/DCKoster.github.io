        <h2></h2>
    
        <p>The model will be presented in the public announcement logic language \( \mathcal{L}_{K[]} \) as referenced in 
            <a href="index.html#references"  class="reference-link">van Ditmarsch and Kooi (2008)</a> as an \( S5_3 \) 
            Kripke Model \( M = \langle S, \sim, V \rangle \) with agents \( A = \{a, b, c\} \).</p>

        <p>Since it is an \( S5 \) model, all accessibility relations are equivalence relations (symmetric, transitive, reflexive). 
            Reflexive relations will not be drawn in the figures. Edges represent symmetric arrows. 
            Furthermore, there is always either 0 or 1 edge between each world, 
            where the edge represents a symmetric relation \( \sim_i \) for agent \( i \). 
            This is because the riddle states that one of three has the sum of the other two, 
            and therefore each of the three persons knows they have either the sum themselves, 
            or they have the difference of the two values they see on the othersâ€™ heads. 
            So the only edges for one person are between two such possible worlds, 
            and these never overlap with the equivalence relations of the others. 
            Finally, if there is a relation \( w \sim_i u \) for some agent \( i \) where in world \( w \) agent \( i \) 
            has the sum and in world \( u \) agent \( i \) has the difference, 
            there is no relation \( w \sim_i v \) nor \( u \sim_i v \). 
            This means that the transitivity of the model does not matter.</p>
        
        <p>Each world \( w \) in \( S \) represents 3 numbers \( n_a \), \( n_b \), and \( n_c \) and is referenced as \( (n_a, n_b, n_c) \) 
            corresponding to three positive integers which are the values on the heads of the three participants, 
            in the order of Achmed, Bert, and Carl respectively. Since one of these three values has to be the sum of the other two, 
            worlds follow one of these three rules:</p>
        
        <ol class="indented">
            <li>\( n_a = n_b + n_c \)</li>
            <li>\( n_b = n_a + n_c \)</li>
            <li>\( n_c = n_a + n_b \)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The riddle does not state any upper bound for the numbers. The only constraint is that they are positive integers 
            and therefore larger than 0. When converting the numbers \( n_a \), \( n_b \), and \( n_c \) to atomic propositions, 
            there is technically an infinite number of atomic propositions in each world. 
            For example, the atomic proposition \( 1_a \) means "Achmed's number is 1". 
            And for all worlds \( w = (n_a, n_b, n_c) \):</p>
        
        <ul class="indented">
            <li>\( w \in V(x_a) \) iff \( n_a = x \)</li>
            <li>\( w \in V(x_b) \) iff \( n_b = x \)</li>
            <li>\( w \in V(x_c) \) iff \( n_c = x \)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Therefore \( M, (1, 2, 3) \vDash 1_a \land 2_b \land 3_c \). Since there is no upper bound, 
            the Kripke model would also at first glance have to include an infinite number of worlds to create an accurate model, 
            though this is not necessary as will be explained in <a href="strategy.html">the strategy section</a>. </p>
        
        <p>We regard a public announcement as a model transformer, so the truthful public announcement \( \varphi \) 
            restricts the Kripke model to the states where \( \varphi \) holds. 
            The four announcements from the riddle can be written in \( \mathcal{L}_{K[]} \) 
            formally as three sets of infinite announcements plus one final announcement as follows:</p>
        
        <ol class="indented">
            <li>\( \neg K_a 1_a \land \neg K_a 2_a \land \ldots \land \neg K_a x_a \) (for all \( x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \))</li>
            <li>\( \neg K_b 1_b \land \neg K_b 2_b \land \ldots \land \neg K_b x_b \) (for all \( x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \))</li>
            <li>\( \neg K_c 1_c \land \neg K_c 2_c \land \ldots \land \neg K_c x_c \) (for all \( x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \))</li>
            <li>\( K_a 50_a \)</li>
        </ol>
